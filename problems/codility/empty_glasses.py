# There are N empty glasses with a capacity of 1,2,â€¦,N liters(there is exactly one glass of each unique capacity)
# You want to pour exactly K liters of water into glasses.
# Each glass may be either full or empty(a glass cannot be partially filled).
# What is the minimum number of glasses that you need to contain K liters of water?

# Example1
#      Given N=5, K=8, should return 2.You can use 2 glasses with capacity 3,5 to hold 8 liters of water
# Example2
#      Given N=4, K=10, should return 4. (1,2,3,4)
# Example3
#      Given N=1, K=2, should return -1.
# Example4
#      Given N=10, K=5, should return 1. (5)


# Solution with greedy algorithm
